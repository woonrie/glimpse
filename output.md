## Introduction

The US federal government is currently at its debt ceiling of 31.46 trillion US Dollars. Treasury Secretary Jamie Ellen has been using extraordinary measures to prevent a total shutdown, but if these measures fail, the US government could default on its debt. This could be a severe situation for the US, as we’ve seen how countries like Greece and Sri Lanka have been crippled by missing payments on their debt obligations. 

But is the fact that the government keeps needing to push this debt ceiling higher and higher a real problem? Is the US headed towards a debt crisis? 

## Exploring the Debt Ceiling

The debt ceiling is currently impeding the treasury, but it can be hiked at any time. In fact, it’s been hiked by Congress an average of 1.2 times a year since 1960. The only reason they haven’t done so this year is that Republicans are trying to get spending concessions from the president before voting on an extension. 

## Understanding US Debt

When governments spend more than they earn in a given year, they need to borrow the difference. In the US, this is done primarily through the issuance or sale of Treasury bonds to individual and institutional investors. Most of the money is owed to America’s own citizens, with roughly a quarter being owed to foreign holders. 

From 2015 to 2019, tax revenue collected by the US federal government has actually fallen by 1.2 percent in real terms, despite spending continuing to rise in line with GDP growth. This has caused the federal debt balance to rise at an average annual inflation-adjusted pace of 5.7 percent. 

## Measuring US Debt

Total debt isn’t by itself a good gauge of a country’s solvency, so economists often look more towards a country’s debt to GDP when trying to gauge a country’s debt burden. In the US, this measure is currently the highest level it’s been since the end of the second world war. Every time the US has experienced a severe economic shock, such as the bursting of the .com bubble in 2000, the financial crisis of 2008, and the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020, the debt to GDP ratio has jumped. 

## Is a Debt Crisis Imminent?

Given the level of US debt, it’s no wonder why some have gone so far as to claim that the US is headed towards a debt crisis. But before you invest in canned soups and underground shelters, it’s worth keeping in mind that the US has a number of advantages in managing its debt load. 

The US economy is fundamentally very different from countries like Greece or Sri Lanka. The US enjoys much more industry diversification, access to capital, and lower reliance on crucial imports like food or energy. The US also has the advantage of controlling its own currency, and has historically been able to keep inflation below double digits. The international dominance of the US dollar has helped keep inflation below the double digits, even as the government has enacted record spending packages. 

The US also benefits from very low interest rates. The government currently has a weighted average interest rate of just 2.07 percent, and interest payments take up 9.7 percent of the money the government brings in. Even with a massive debt load, the cost of maintaining this debt is actually lower than it’s been in the past. 

## Conclusion

While the US debt situation is a cause for concern, the US is still far away from a Greece or Sri Lanka-like outcome. The US has a number of advantages in managing its debt load, and the market doesn’t seem to believe that a debt crisis is inbound. 

Nonetheless, the US does have an ever-growing liability that will eventually need to be addressed. With inflation as high as it is, the Federal Reserve may need to continue hiking rates, and the government will need to offer higher rates to attract capital from investors. If the US government doesn’t address the burgeoning debt balance, they could run into a debt spiral. 

The US faces the risk of another economic shock coming along and really screwing things up, given how stretched thin things really are. We really are in unchartered waters, and the US debt situation matters for those within and outside the country.
